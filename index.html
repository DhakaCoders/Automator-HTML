          <p>I paid $15,000 to create this software so you could get results for you.</p>
          <p>I paid for it so you don't have to.</p>
          <p>If you paid half, that would be $7,500.</p>
          <p>If you paid one quarter of it, that would be $3,750.</p>
          <p>If you paid 10% of that, it would be $1,500.</p>
          <p>Since I made it for your benefit, it might make sense to charge these prices because between the cost of creating it and the cost of maintaining the servers with all of our advanced members using it every day, as you can see, it's not cheap.</p>
          <p>We thought long and hard about this.</p>
          <p>On one hand, we want everyone to have it.</p>
          <p>We want to make it free.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we can't stay in business by just giving everything away. </p>
          <p>We have incredible costs to keep the websites running, not to mention our cost in purchasing the software out of our own pockets.</p>
          <p>We thought long and hard about charging $500 knowing full well you can get all your money back in credit once you use this product.</p>
